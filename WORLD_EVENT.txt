1. How to Trigger the Event:
   Click on any tile to trigger the event.
2. What should happen when the event is triggered:
   The immediate tiles including the tile you clicked, if it is a background tile will
   turn into a dark soil tile, instead of the normal background. The click will also trigger
   a demon to spawn. If Nezuko is in the vicinity of the changed tiles, she will transform.
3. The affected entity (Nezuko) should transform into Zenitsu who will chase
   demons and try to kill them. If there are no demons left, he will chase Nezuko.
4. The new entity are demon entities. The demon entities should be chasing Nezuko. If there are no
Nezukos to chase, the demons will start killing the cakes completely, meaning they cannot respawn.
